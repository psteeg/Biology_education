# Biology education
A collection of Rstudio scripts, including spatial and statistical data analysis, from my biology education.

The script "Bachelorcourse_ETDA_project" contains a short report of a project which included statistical data analysis in Rstudio. The script was created during the course Ecological Theory & Data Analysis that I followed during my biology education. 

The script "Internship_script_linkage_temp_pnof" was created during my research internship of my biology education. The aim of my study was to predict species occurrence based on environmental stressor levels using spatial data analysis in Rstudio. The script demonstrates how I linked temperature data to fish species occurrence, where species occurrence was quantified as potentially not occurring fraction (PNOF) of fish. 

The script "Internship_script_linkage_temp_pnof_statistics" is part of the same project as the file described above, but this script only includes the statistical analysis of temperature data.
